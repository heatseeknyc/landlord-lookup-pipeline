This is one of 3 project repos for the HeatSeek Landlord Lookup portal, currently up and running under:

    https://lookup.heatseek.org/

This repo provides the "data pipeline" for the working portal -- that is, code to cleanse, extract, and load raw datasets from the NYC data ecosystem into a Postgres that the web portal can run off of (and on which some elementary analysis of the datasets can be performed). 

If you'd like to build or replicate the pipeline yourself, or are curious about the data 
sources used, have a look at the `Getting Started <notes/Getting-Started.rst>`_ guide_.
