A place for data files (usually reference data) that originate here in the source tree.

Generally these are for reference, of "config"-like tables (not for large entity or fact tables).

This might include datasets we've made up on our own, e.g ``acris/refdata-docfam.csv`` which provides certain functional groupings for ACRIS Document Control Codes; or datasets which are derived offshoots from other open datasets -- like ``pluto/refdata-bldgclass``, which is just a fork of the City's list of Building Class captions, but simplified and shortened a bit for presentation in our UIs.
