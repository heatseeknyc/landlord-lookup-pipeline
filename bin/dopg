#!/bin/bash -ue
#
# A simple wrapper for the Python script, below.
# Which in turn simply passes credentials + current databse name to psql. 
# Then you just do
#
#      dopg path-to-script.sql
#
# To run your SQL script.  
# It's a bit brittle at present, but works for the intended use case, provided
# you run it from the standard working directory (i.e. the directory above this one).
