Notes on setting up postgres, out-of-the-box.

The setup is not complicated, but assumes you have some basic familiar
with the installation process + basic admin practices for postgres, or 
can brush up on them quickly.


(1) Installation + Setup 

We prefer to do a custom install (apart from whatever you might
already have installed locally), to the following location (which
should be owned by root):

    /opt/pg9

Which will correspond to the environment settings in the .rc file:

    bin/init-env.rc

which you'll want to source every time you do admin-level stuff in 
this project.

If you haven't used postgres in a while, recall that the service 
start goes like this:

    postgres -D $PGROOT/data/

While the interactive terminal (with superuser login) goes like this:

    psql -U postgres

It should require no password (or perhaps password 'postgres') the
first time you run it.  The first thing you'll want to do is set a new 
superuser password:

    alter user postgres with password 'newpassword';


(2) Choose a database name + create a database: 

Pick a name, any name, for the database you'll be using:

    create database nyc1;

Whatever you call your database, you'll need to propogate this name
to the following script / config files:
  
    config/postgres.json
    config/pgpass.txt
    sql/create-roles.sql


(3) Create 'readuser' and 'writeuser' roles:

    sudo su postgres
    /opt/pg9/bin/psql -U postgres -d nyc1 -f sql/create-roles.sql

This should be the last command we need to do via either the
system or the database 'postgres' user.


(4) Push pgpass file

The 'pgpass' file is the preferred mechanism for managing stored
database user passwords in a postgres environment.  If desired, you
can edit the source file to change the default password settings: 

   vi config/pgpass.txt

Then run the following script to push it out to its working location: 

   sudo bin/push-pgpass.sh

It may be good at this point to verify that the password settings 
actually work in regard to the roles just created: 

   psql -U readuser nyc1
