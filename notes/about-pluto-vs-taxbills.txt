Some quick stats on the overlap between the pluto + taxbills datasets (16v2 and Sep 2016, respectively).

    select count(*) from flat.taxbills; 1082459
    select count(*) from core.pluto; 858370

    select count(*) from flat.taxbills as a left join core.pluto as b on b.bbl = a.bbl where b.bbl is not null; 848703
    select count(*) from flat.taxbills as a left join core.pluto as b on b.bbl = a.bbl where b.bbl is null; 233756

    select count(*) from flat.taxbills as a right join core.pluto as b on b.bbl = a.bbl where a.bbl is not null; 848703
    select count(*) from flat.taxbills as a right join core.pluto as b on b.bbl = a.bbl where a.bbl is null; 9667

Or equivalently:

    select count(*) from core.pluto as a left join flat.taxbills as b on b.bbl = a.bbl where b.bbl is null; 9667

Of special interest are the 9667 rows in pluto that are -not- in the taxbills dataset.

We suspect many of these might be "stale" records from adjoined lots, e.g.: 

    1005240070 | 181 MERCER STREET           | NEW YORK UNIVERSITY   | P          |          0 |          0 |           0
    1005350020 | 251 MERCER STREET           | NEW YORK UNIVERSITY   | P          |          0 |          0 |           0
    1005358020 | 251 MERCER STREET           | NEW YORK UNIVERSITY   | P          |          0 |          0 |           0

But we don't really know, and need to investigate.
